# Open-Tools
Custom built tools to run an electronic repair shop, automotive repair shop, or any business that has the need to provide quotes. Most files will be HTML, with some CSS and Java Script.

***In the coming months i'll be adding repair tracking functionality. Eventually this will be a full suite of widgets/pages to fully opperate a business such as my own. I'm hoping to use Stripe API for a payment gateway, as well as eventually adding support for uber(ish) courier tracking for service requests.***

**Rather than pay a company $99/month for instant quote widgets, use mine to power your business and promote lead generation for free!**

*For now, this is a very basic quote tool that you can customize to your liking.*
